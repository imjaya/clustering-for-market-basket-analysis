# clustering-for-market-basket-analysis

In this assignment, we perform K-Means and GMM&EM clustering for mall customer data.
Our code computes clusters for K=4,6,8, and 10 starting with random initialization of cluster centroids.
Then, it plots the graph for clustering results on the first two principal components using PCA analysis.
Our choice is K=6 for this data based on the elbow plot and PCA analysis. Therefore, the code plots the results 
for individual features when K=6.

How to run?
- Add "Mall_Customers.csv" file to the same directory with the python file "Team11_Midterm2Clustering.ipynb"
- Using Jupyter Notebook, run Team11_Midterm2Clustering.ipynb
